# Private Keyword

[Read this (very short) article](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/advanced/private_methods.html)

### Routes Reference:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # tells my app what do do/ how to respond to HTTP requests
  resources :bagels, only: [:index, :new, :create]

  # when I receive a GET request to /bagels
  # go TO the bagels controller, for a method called index
  # construct a helper method called bagels_path

# helper method is bagels_path
  # get '/bagels', to: 'bagels#index', as: 'bagels'
  # get '/bagels/new', to: 'bagels#new', as: 'new_bagel'
  # post '/bagels', to: 'bagels#create', as: 'bagels'
  # get '/bagels/:id', to: 'bagels#show', as: 'bagel'
end

# SINATRA
# get '/bagels' do
#   #controller code
# end
```

### Annotated BagelsController

```ruby
class BagelsController < ApplicationController

  # show ALL bagels
  def index
    @bagels = Bagel.all #ask Bagel model for data and pass @bagels instance var to the view
    render :index # look for folder called /bagels in the views folder, then render the index.html.erb
  end

  # show form to create a new bagel
  def new
    @bagel = Bagel.new # create a blank instance to pass to form_for
    render :new # render app/views/bagels/new.html.erb
  end

# POST request from our new bagel form
# create is called when our app receives a POST request to /bagels
  def create
    @bagel = Bagel.new(bagel_params) # pass in return value of private bagel_params method, which is a hash of whitelisted attributes

    if @bagel.valid? # checking validations; method is provided by ActiveRecord
      @bagel.save # if bagel is valid, save to database
      flash[:notice] = 'Bagel created!' # save a notice for our user in the flash hash
      redirect_to(bagels_path) # redirect fires new GET request, which will hit the BagelsController#index
    else # if bagel is not valid
      # rails provides a method for sending data across multiple requests
      # we can access this via flash[:KEY] hash syntax
      # flash[:errors] = @bagel.errors.full_messages
      # because render(:new) is NOT a new get request, I don't need to send a flash along

      # because I am not redirecting, instance var @bagel maintains the attributes from the form
      render(:new) # render DOES NOT TRIGGER NEW GET REQUEST
    end
  end

#everything below private keyword is private
private
  def bagel_params
    # return a hash of whitelisted attributes from params
    params.require(:bagel).permit(:name, :price, :tasty)
    # strong params returns a hash of attributes {name: 'some name', price: 2, tasty: true}
  end

end
```

### Why Use Strong Params?

- From the docs (linked below):

```
With strong parameters, Action Controller parameters are forbidden to be used in Active Model mass assignments until they have been whitelisted. This means that you'll have to make a conscious decision about which attributes to allow for mass update. This is a better security practice to help prevent accidentally allowing users to update sensitive model attributes.
```

### Validations

- Why use validations?

- This is your typical user:
  ![Your users on your site](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bd5a0e0355fa6a8c1f5478f197be5562a479d41a/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e67697068792e636f6d2f6d656469612f5a665531314f44616e6c6f43412f67697068792e676966)

- We want to protect against unwanted, unexpected data. We should be programming defensively
- For example, would it make sense for our app to allow a bagel with an empty name to be created?

- ActiveRecord provides us _several_ built in validations and I **highly recommend reading the docs** (linked below)
- If we need custom functionality, we can also write our own methods
- These validations will be run **any time i try to write to the database** -> `Bagel.create`, `Bagel.update`, `Bagel#save`

```ruby
class Bagel < ApplicationRecord
  validates(:name, { presence: true, uniqueness: true })
  # validates :price, numericality: { presence: true, only_integer: true }
  validate :validate_num_for_price

  def validate_num_for_price
    if self.price.class != Fixnum || self.price > 30
      # errors array -> [{price: "Needs to be a number less than 30"}]
      errors.add(:price, "Needs to be a number less than 30")
    end
  end

end
```
