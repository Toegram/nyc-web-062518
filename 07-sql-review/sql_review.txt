Write the SQL to return all of the rows in the artists tables

SELECT * FROM artists
WHERE name like "Black%"

SELECT * FROM artists
WHERE name like "%lack"


create a table named 'fans' with an autoincrementing ID that's a primary key and a name field of type text

CREATE TABLE fans (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)


INSERT INTO fans (artist_id, name) VALUES (276, "Elbin")


select * from artists where name like '%tang%'


Return fans that are not fans of the Black Eyed Peas (artist id = 169)

SELECT * from fans where artist_id not in (SELECT artistid FROM artists WHERE name like "%lack%")


select * from fans 
join artists
on artists.artistid == fans.artist_id


1. Which if any are foreign keys?
2. What's the sql for joining artists / albums

select name, title from albums
join artists
on albums.artistid == artists.artistid


select * from albums
join artists, fans on artists.artistid == fans.artist_id
and albums.artistid == artists.artistid 

ambiguous column name: main.artists.ArtistId: select * from artists
join artists, fans
join fans on artists.artistid == fans.artist_id
and albums.artistid == artists.artistid
